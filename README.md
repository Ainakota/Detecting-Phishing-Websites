# Detecting-Phishing-Websites

Data phishing has emerged as a prevalent and successful method employed by cybercriminals to deceive individuals and illicitly obtain their personal and financial information. In our increasingly internet-dependent world, where we conduct a significant portion of our daily activities online, fraudsters have found a fertile ground to execute targeted phishing attacks. These modern-day phishing attempts have become remarkably sophisticated, making them harder to detect. Astonishingly, a recent study conducted by Intel revealed that an overwhelming 97% of security experts failed to differentiate between genuine emails and phishing emails. This alarming statistic underscores the urgent need for a deeper understanding of data phishing and the implementation of robust countermeasures to safeguard ourselves from these insidious attacks.
